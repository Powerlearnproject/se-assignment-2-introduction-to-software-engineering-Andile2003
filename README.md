# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software engineering is descipline that involves the systematic development of software product through well defined processes, methodologies and principles. It emphasizes the use of engineering principles and practices to ensure that software systems are reliable and meet the needs of users and stakeholders. Traditional programming refers to the act of writing code to implement specific functionalities within a software system. This programming may lack the structured processes methodologies and considerations for scapablity that are intergral to software engineering. (Chat gpt and slides)
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
The Software Development Life Cycle is a framework that describes the stages involved in the development of software from its start to its end. It has phases which are Requirement analysis in this phase the detailed requirements are gathered and documented. Functional and non-functional requirement are identified. The second phase Design where architecture and systems design are created based on the requirements. Data structures, algorithms and interphases are defined. The third phase is the Implementation which is when code is written and the software is built according to the design specifications. The forth phase is Testing where conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements, detects and issues are identified. The fifth phase is Deployment where software is released to users or customers, Deploment plans and rollback procedures are prepared. The sixth and the last phase is  Maintenance which provides ongoing support, updates and enhancements to the software after deployment. (Chat gpt and slides)
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Agile model is interactive and incremental approach focused on the flexibility, collaboration and responding chande. Waterfall model has a sequantial approach with istinct phase flowing towards like a waterfall. According to approach of these models, waterfall model is less flexible to changes once phase is completed whilst agile model emphasizes flexibility and adapability. Waterfall model limit collaboration between stakeholders and development teams whilst agile model promotes collaboration and communication among cross-functional teams. Waterfall models emphasizes extenssive upfornt documentation including detailed requirements whilst the Agile model values working software over comprehensive documentation. (Chat gpt)
Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
It is the process of eliciting, documenting, validating and managing requirements throughout the software development lifecycle. It is a crucial aspect aspect of both Agile and Waterfall models, ensuring that the software development process starts with a clear understanding of what needs to be built and why. Requirement engineering is a critical aspect of the software development lifecycle, ensuring that software projects are successfully delivered on time, within budget, and to the satisfaction of stakeholders. It helps bridge the gap between user expectations and software implementation, leading to the development of high-quality software systems. (Chat gpt and slides)
Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Modularity in software design refers to the practice of breaking down system into smaller, self-contained module or component each responsible for a specific functionality or feature. These modules are designed to be independent of one another, with well defined interfaces that allow them to interact with each other while hiding their internal working. Modularity improves maintanability and scalability of software systems. The maintaiability has isolation of changes, code reusability and encapsulation. In scapability there is ease of extension, parallel development and resource allocation. (Chat gpt and slides)
Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Unit testing involves testing indivdual units or components of the software in isolation. Intergration testing involes testing the interactions between different units or components of the software. It verifies that these units work together as inteded when intergrated. Systems testing involves testing the entire software system as a whole. It verifies that the system meets the specified requirements and behaves as expected in various scenarios. The last testing is the Acceptance testing which involves testing the software to ensure that it meets the stakeholders acceptance criteria and is ready for deployment. Testing is very crucial in software development because it helps in delivering high-quality, reliable and secure software that meets the user expectations and business objectives. It is an intergral part of the development process and contributes to the success of software projects. (Chat gpt and slides)
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Version control systems are tools that track changes to files and directories over time, allowing multiple developers to collaborate on a project while maintaining a history of changes. Git is one of the version control systems it is distributed version control system, which means the developers has afull copy of the respository, including its history. The second version control system is a Subversion, it is centralized version control system, where there is a single central respository that stores the entire history of the project. The third version control is Mercurial which is a distributed version control system similar to Git, providing each developer with a full copy of the repository. (Chat gpt and slides)
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
The role of a software project manager is multifaceted, requiring a combination of technical knowledge, leadership skills and organizational abilities to successfully deliver software projects on time, within budget and to the satisfaction of stakeholders. The key responsibilities of a software project manager are planning, team management, communication and risk management. The key challenges are scope creep, resource constraints, stakeholder management, technical complexity and team collaboration. (Chat gpt and slides)
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Software maintenance refers to the ongoing process of managing and updating software after it has been deployed. It involves making modifications, enhancements and fixes to the software to ensure that it continues to meet the needs of its users and remains compatible with changing environments such as new hardware. Types of maintenance are corrective maintenance, adaptive maintenance, perfective maintenance and preventive maintenance. The maintenance is essential for maximizing the value of the software investments, ensuring the continued relevant and effectiveness of software systems and meeting the f users in a dynamic and evolving technological landscape. (Chat gpt)
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
The ethical issues that software engineers might face are privacy concerns, bias and discrimination, security vulnerabilities, intellectual property and environmental impact. Software engineers should familiaarize themselves with ethical guidlines, they should also consider the boader impact, also engage in ongoing education and lastly promote transparency and accountability.
